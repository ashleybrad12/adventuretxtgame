# Adventure Game

An adventure text-based game using Python3.
The object of the game is to escape the house. Each room contains an obstacle that the user must overcome. They must choose from the available options. 


## Specifications

1. Descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.

2. Import modules and use functions from those modules.

- The time.sleep function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.
- The random.choice or random.randint function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.
- Use the input function in combination with conditional statements (e.g., if and while) to create an interactive program.
- The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.

3. The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:
- Whether the player wins or loses
- Whether to restart or exit after the game is over

4. Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input.
- If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option.
5. The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
